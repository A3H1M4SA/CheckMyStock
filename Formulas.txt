BVPS = Total Shareholders' Equity / Shares Outstanding

Book Value Per Share (BVPS)
CopyInsert
BVPS = Total Shareholders' Equity / Shares Outstanding
With Alpha Vantage data: totalShareholderEquity / commonStockSharesOutstanding

With FMP data: We're using two approaches:

When common stock value is available: (totalStockholdersEquity - commonStock) / sharesOutstanding
Simple version: totalStockholdersEquity / sharesOutstanding
Debt-to-Equity Ratio
CopyInsert
Debt-to-Equity = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Equity
With Alpha Vantage data: totalLiabilities / totalShareholderEquity

With FMP data: totalLiabilities / totalStockholdersEquity

Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)
CopyInsert
ROIC = NOPAT / Invested Capital
Where:

NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax) = EBIT Ã— (1 - Tax Rate)
Tax Rate = Income Tax Expense / Income Before Tax
Invested Capital = Total Equity + Total Debt - Cash
With Alpha Vantage data:

EBIT from income statement
Tax calculation from income tax expense and income before tax
Invested capital combines equity, debt, and cash from balance sheet
With FMP data:

Similar calculation but when EBIT isn't available, we fall back to using Net Income as an approximation for NOPAT
Dividend Yield
The dividend yield is obtained directly from the API:

CopyInsert
Dividend Yield = Annual Dividend / Current Price
In our code, we simply display the lastDiv value from the Financial Modeling Prep API, which already contains the calculated dividend yield.

These ratios provide important insights into a company's financial health, profitability, and valuation from multiple perspectives.
